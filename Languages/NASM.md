# Register System

Registers:
- segment registers
- general-purpose registers
- special registers

### Segment registers
Segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES, GS, and FS) are not used in the “flat” memory model.
### General-purpose registers
32-bit:

| EAX | EBX | ECX | EDX | ESI | EDI | EBP | ESP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

16-bit:  
In each 32-bit register, a distinct lower half (the lower 16 bits) is defined, which has a separate name obtained by dropping the letter E. In other words, it is also possible to operate on the 16-bit registers AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, and SP, which represent the lower halves of the corresponding 32-bit registers.

| AX  | BX  | CX  | DX  | SI  | DI  | BP  | SP  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

8-bit:
The AX, BX, CX, and DX registers are further subdivided into lower and upper parts, which are now 8-bit wide. The remaining general-purpose registers do not have such distinct one-byte subregisters.

Names:
- AX - accumulator
- BX - base
- CX - counter
- DX - data
- SI - source index
- DI - destination index
- BP - base pointer
- SP - stack pointer
### Special registers


| AH  | BH  | CH  | DH  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AL  | BL  | CL  | DL  |
